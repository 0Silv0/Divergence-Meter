# Divergence-Meter
Based on [Tom Titors divergence meter project](http://brotoro.com/dm/index.html), re-written in C.                                                

I wanted to learn embedded C and the divergence meter is a cool project, so I decided to try and reverse engineer Tom Titors assembly code into C to be able to add some features and learn along the way.
Features to add/currently working on.

- [ ] I2C error handling
- [ ] Tube Display
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] User settings input
- [ ] World line generation
- [ ] Optimization and bug fixes
- [ ] Daylight savings
- [ ] Cross fading (maybe? Would be cool but this is not important)
